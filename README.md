# B

This is an infinite Pixel Canvas where anyone can draw anything. There is a persistant instance running from the server using MySQL, and the frontend React website communicates to it through a NodeJS backend, hosted on the same server.

Link to a demo page in action here: [Pixel Canvas](http://comic.placefor.us/map_dev).

**TODO**
- Encapsulate all line draws into a single call that is sent to the server on the update tick
- Add guidelines showing the chunk borders
- Add option to enter a location and teleport the canvas there
